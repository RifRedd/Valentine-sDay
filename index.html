        <p class="letter-body">As I am writing this, I am staring at the photo of us just above, and I can't help but tear up. 3 Valentine's Days! I can't believe the time has gone by so fast already. Every second has been perfect. I hope you know how happy you make me. I get excited every time I see a text or a snapchat from you, and my heart races when you call. I can't wait for the many, many more Valentine's Day's that we will spend together - especially the ones when us being together isn't difficult to make happen. </p>
        <p class="letter-body">Baby, I am so proud of you. I don't know when you aren't busy, between the LSAT, your 20 units of classes, or LEAD work, you always find the time for me. And I appreciate it, and you, so very much. I am yours. I love you!!</p>
